# public-api-requests
 An app for a fictional company to display employees contact information.

The app was made using Fetch to retrieve data from randomuser.me, a free api used to generate random users data. We use it to generate a list of twelve contact cards for each contact.

Each card has information like a profile picture, name, email, city and phone. When a contact card is clicked, a modal is shown with more information about the selected user.
