# public-api-request website
 An app for a fictional company to display employees contact information.

The app was made using Fetch to retrieve data from randomuser.me, a free api used to generate random users data. We use it to generate a list of twelve contact cards for each contact.

Each card has information like a profile picture, name, email, city and phone. When a contact card is clicked, a modal is shown with more information about the selected user.

Changes to style: Only color
 "pale spring bud" (#CCD5AE, #E9EDC9),  "Cornsilk" (#FEFAE0), "Papaya Whip" (#FAEDCD), and "Fawn" (#D4A373).
